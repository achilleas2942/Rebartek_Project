# Rebartek  
**PUMA 560 - Achilleas Version**

## Overview
This project provides a Python implementation for working with the PUMA 560 robotic arm. It includes features for calculating forward and inverse kinematics, visualizing Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) coordinate frames, and running a simple path planning algorithm.

## Instructions

1. Open the `rebartek.py` file using Visual Studio (VS) or your preferred Python IDE.
2. Install all required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python rebartek.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to:
   - Compute forward or inverse kinematics
   - View Denavit-Hartenberg coordinate frames
   - Execute the path planning algorithm

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - numpy
  - matplotlib

You can install all dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

## Example
After running the script, you will be guided through a series of options, like choosing to perform forward kinematics or visualizing the robot's coordinate frames.
